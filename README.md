## Methodology

### Data Cleanup
Prior to visualization, the dataset was cleaned using the following checks:
1. **Quantity Validation**: Ensure quantities are not less than 1. Entries with negative quantities (returns) are excluded.
2. **Unit Price Validation**: Remove entries where unit price is below $0 to eliminate erroneous data.

This was achieved through conditional formulas and data transformation techniques available in Tableau and Power BI.

### Visualization Development
- Each visualization corresponds to a specific business question and is placed on a separate tab for easy navigation.
- Tabs are named as follows:
  - **Q1**: Revenue Trends
  - **Q2**: Top Countries by Revenue
  - **Q3**: Top Customers by Revenue
  - **Q4**: Regional Demand

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For building detailed visuals with data transformation capabilities.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial exploration and verification of raw data.
